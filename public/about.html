<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a former Army Combat Medic. I have worked in Physical Therapy for many years before moving into a teaching position with K-12. I moved to teaching for the flexibility and time it gave me to be with my family.</p>

<p>For many reasons I have decided that now is a great time to persue my passion of learning to code and becoming a Software Engineer. I am excited to be in this new chapter of my life and I am loving the opportunities it has given me to grow, expand, and explore.</p>

<p>I plan to continue to develop my skills and knowledge base into the future. Constantly learning and growing as does the industry.</p>
